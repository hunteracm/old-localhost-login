An easy to use [offline] attendance form.

* Prerequisites

** Recommended
It is recommended to use a [[https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/][python virtual environment]]. You can create the environment at the root
with:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
virtualenv venv
#+END_SRC

Then you can activate the environment:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
. /venv/bin/activate
#+END_SRC

Note: You can deactivate the environment with =deactivate=, but it should be active while you run the app.

** Necessary
Whether you've chosen to use a virtual environment or now, you have to install the application
dependencies. You can use the =requirements.txt= like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
#+END_SRC

You must also have sqlite3 installed (use your package manager).

* Usage

** The Site
After the dependencies are ready, run the application:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
python app.py
#+END_SRC

Navigate to =localhost:5000= and the website should display. Users can sign in now.
